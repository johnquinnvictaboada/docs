# Using Grpcurl to Interact with U5C

## Introduction to Grpcurl

Grpcurl is a command-line tool for interacting with gRPC services, much like how curl is used for HTTP. While HTTP APIs are widespread and familiar, gRPC is becoming popular, especially for microservices due to its efficiency and performance. However, the binary protocol used by gRPC makes it harder to work with traditional tools like curl. Enter Grpcurl - which solves this by bringing that ease and familiarity of curl to gRPC.

## Installing Grpcurl

You can install Grpcurl on various operating systems. Detailed installation instructions and binaries are available on the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl#installation).

## Connecting to a U5C Server

To interact with U5C, you first need to connect to a compliant server. You can choose one of the [available servers](/servers) for U5C.

### Example: Connecting to a Local [Dolos Node](https://github.com/txpipe/dolos) 

```sh
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:50051 list
```

This command lists the services available on a local Dolos node running on port 50051.

### Example: Connecting to a Local [Cardano Node API](https://github.com/blinklabs-io/cardano-node-api)

```sh
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:9090 list
```

This command lists the services available on a Cardano Node API running on port 9090.

## Listing Services and Methods

For the following sections, weâ€™ll assume that a UTxORPC node is running locally at `localhost:50051`. If your node is hosted elsewhere, simply replace `"localhost:50051"` with the correct URL and port number.

To list all the services or describe a specific method provided by the U5C endpoint, you can use the following commands:

```sh
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:50051 list utxorpc.v1alpha.sync.SyncService
```

## Describing a Method

To get more details about a specific gRPC method, you can describe it using Grpcurl. For instance, if you want to describe the `FetchBlock` method of the `SyncService`:

```sh
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:50051 describe utxorpc.v1alpha.sync.SyncService.FetchBlock
```

This will return details about the method:

```sh
utxorpc.v1alpha.sync.SyncService.FetchBlock is a method:
rpc FetchBlock ( .utxorpc.v1alpha.sync.FetchBlockRequest ) returns ( .utxorpc.v1alpha.sync.FetchBlockResponse );
```

You can also describe the request message for this method:

```sh
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:50051 describe utxorpc.v1alpha.sync.FetchBlockRequest
```

The output will look like this:

```sh
utxorpc.v1alpha.sync.FetchBlockRequest is a message:
// Request to fetch a block by its reference.
message FetchBlockRequest {
  repeated .utxorpc.v1alpha.sync.BlockRef ref = 1;
  .google.protobuf.FieldMask field_mask = 2;
}
```

## Executing a Request/Reply Method

Once you understand the request structure, you can execute a method like `FetchBlock` to fetch a specific block. Here's an example using a block's `index` and `hash` which are its parameters to make a Block Reference or a `ref`:

```sh
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"ref": [{"index": 61724995, "hash": "1eVsN7YMlpLBKAFCNjes+zcDa/fiEtQ5d1uP6cdtj/U="}]}' localhost:50051 utxorpc.v1alpha.sync.SyncService.FetchBlock
```

But do note that this sample depends on which network you're in right now. You may find a block's `index` and `hash` from your node's network through other sources in Cardano. But for the current example we're using a `preview` node.

In this example, the block hash is base64-encoded. The response looks similar to this:
```json
{
  "block": [
    {
      "nativeBytes": "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",

        },
        "body": {}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Executing a Streaming Method

gRPC supports streaming methods, which allow for continuous data exchange between the client and server. To execute a streaming method like `FollowTip` in the `SyncService`, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Describe the Method

First, understand the method:

```sh
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:50051 describe utxorpc.v1alpha.sync.SyncService.FollowTip
```

### Step 2: Execute the Streaming Method

Now, you can execute the method and observe the real-time streaming responses:

```sh
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:50051 utxorpc.v1alpha.sync.SyncService.FollowTip
```

## Conclusion

Grpcurl makes interacting with gRPC services as simple as using curl with HTTP APIs. It opens the door for developers to easily test and interact with gRPC services, making the transition from HTTP to gRPC smoother and more approachable.
