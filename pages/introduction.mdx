# Introduction

UtxoRpc is a cutting-edge protocol designed to facilitate seamless interaction with UTxO-based blockchains through gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Call) technology. By leveraging the high-performance communication capabilities of gRPC, UtxoRpc streamlines the process of querying and managing transactions within UTxO-based blockchain networks.

The UtxoRpc protocol offers a range of features to enhance the user experience, including efficient data retrieval, real-time transaction updates, and simplified integration with existing systems. Built on a foundation of advanced technology, UtxoRpc aims to accelerate the adoption of UTxO-based blockchains by providing a user-friendly, robust, and scalable solution for developers and businesses alike.


## Only a Specification

UtxoRpc serves as a specification of an interface between agents and the blockchain gateway, rather than a concrete implementation. The primary purpose of UtxoRpc is to define a set of standardized methods, data structures, and communication patterns that can be used for interacting with UTxO-based blockchains such as Cardano.

By providing a well-defined specification, UtxoRpc encourages different actors in the ecosystem to contribute their own implementations while ensuring interoperability between them. This approach promotes collaboration and innovation among developers, as they can build on each other's work and leverage existing tools and libraries that adhere to the UtxoRpc specification.

Moreover, the use of a standardized interface specification reduces friction when integrating different parties, as they can all rely on a common set of conventions and protocols to communicate with the blockchain gateway. This simplifies the development process, reduces the potential for errors, and fosters a more cohesive and efficient ecosystem of applications built on UTxO-based blockchains.
